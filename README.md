## About The Project

Since Boston is the state capital and most populous city of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as well as the cultural and financial center of the New England region of the United States. Boston attracts many immigrants and students who come here to study and work. As a result, people here have a high demand for housing. Therefore, my dashboard is aiming to provide the most current real estate rental listing numbers in each area, the average cost of renting a house in each area, and the current real estate listing details by property type(i.e. listed price, address, days on the market etc). 

### Features
It has dropdown menus that allow user to select property type, then the pie chart will display the number of rental houses in that type listed in the market in each area, the bar chart will displayed the average price in the area, and the table will display the specifc details about listing.

#### 1. Dropdown Menu
It allows user to select the property type they want to check. It also allows user type in the property type. If there is no results found in the data, it will return "No results found."

#### 3. Bar Chart
